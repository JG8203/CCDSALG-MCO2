Our study on data structures and algorithms focused on Adjacency Lists, Graphs, HashMaps, and the Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm. We went deep into the intricacies of finding neighboring nodes, utilizing various methods and classes within the Collections library as well as reconstructing the path of BFS. We found out that BFS is efficient enough for traversing graphs because of its linear time complexity O(V+E), it also scales well with the size of any given graph. These insights underscore the importance of properly applying the appropriate data structures to represent real world data. These learnings will personally serve as a foundation for further study by the authors of this paper as they further explore and innovate within the field.
