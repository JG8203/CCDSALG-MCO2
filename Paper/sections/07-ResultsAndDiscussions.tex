In this section, we present and discuss the results of running our application. We examine the program's performance under normal conditions and its handling of various edge cases.

\subsection*{Normal Conditions}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Normal Conditions}

Under normal conditions, our program performs exceptionally well. When given valid input, the program quickly loads the dataset and allows the user to perform operations on the network.

For instance, consider the following interaction:

\begin{verbatim}
	Input file path: ./data/Caltech36.txt
	[1] Get friend list
	[2] Get connection
	[3] Exit
	Enter your choice: 1
	Enter ID of Person: 10
	Person 10 has 2 friends!
	List of friends:
	341 663
\end{verbatim}

In this example, the program correctly identified the friends of person 10 from the Caltech36 dataset. This was verified by using the application \textbf{Cytoscape} and the \textbf{PathExplorer} extension.\cite{shannon2003cytoscape}

\subsection*{Edge Cases}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Edge Cases}

The program also handles various edge cases gracefully. Here are some examples:

\subsubsection{Invalid File Path}

When given an invalid file path, the program displays an error message and prompts the user for a valid file path. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
	Input file path: ./data/nonexistent.txt
	Error: File not found. Please enter a valid file path.
	Input file path: 
\end{verbatim}

This shows that the program is robust to errors in file input, and can recover gracefully from such situations.

\subsubsection{Invalid User ID}

When asked to list the friends of a user who does not exist in the network, the program informs the user that the ID is invalid. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
	Enter your choice: 1
	Enter ID of Person: 99999
	Error: Person 99999 does not exist in the network.
	Enter ID of Person: 
\end{verbatim}

This demonstrates the program's robust error handling capabilities and its ability to provide meaningful feedback to the user.

\subsubsection{Multiple Shortest Paths}

In cases where multiple shortest paths exist between two users, the program arbitrarily selects one to display. This is a result of the BFS algorithm, which does not guarantee a particular shortest path in cases where multiple shortest paths exist.
